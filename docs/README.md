# What is NewCo?

## Overview

A **non-fungible token** (**NFT**) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), a form of digital [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger), that classically can be sold and traded freely. In practice, NFTs are a modern mechanism for web3 users to invest, create and share with others. These remote pieces of blockchain data represent your digital identity.&#x20;

> Non-fungible Tokens are the most inventive and revolutionary aspect of crypto to date. That being said, they are also the least developed.
