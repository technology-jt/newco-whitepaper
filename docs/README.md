# Official White Paper

<mark style="color:purple;">**Veld View**</mark> is a widget-enabled social NFT platform that is focused on bridging the gap between on- and off-chain users.

**The platform is dedicated to bringing an incredibly simple social experience to a space that desperately needs it.**&#x20;

We want to stand on the shoulders of those that have built successful platforms before us. We want to take what works, and learn from it. We want to drive better adoption, for everyone.

And with that advantage, we want to develop in a void that deserves better: web3 and the NFT-media space.&#x20;

## Our Story

The idea behind <mark style="color:purple;">**Veld View**</mark> is simple, and ultimately born out of practical windfalls. It's an accumulation of bad features, both in and out of the web3 space, that many of us have experienced already. And to best explain what we're trying to build, we're going to take a step back.&#x20;

**For most new adopters in web3 and NFT-media space, the process of purchasing an asset is painstakingly complicated**.

And through this process, a lot of valid concerns are usually asked:

{% hint style="danger" %}
1. Do I own this piece of media? Who and how was it created? Are there others like it?
2. Can I trust the seller? Is this a scam? Is it safe to connect my wallet?
3. How do I talk other folks investing in these too?
4. What next?
{% endhint %}

**Most adoption curves tend to end there, full stop.**

The perception of value at risk, and the lack of utility beyond asset accumulation, usually turns most web2 users away. And for the folks that stick around, it's a rabbit-hole of never-ending learning, collecting, and navigating a space that travels at lightspeed.

For the hyper-interested, they've likely established a gambit of applications that help them keep up. There's implicit needs for how they want to engage with the space:&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
1. Users want to talk and connect with like-minded individuals
2. Users want to learn about what's next
3. Users want to see excitement and activity on their platform
4. Users want discretion around data privacy and security
{% endhint %}

**And in pursuit of many of these things, you're likely to make a few mistakes - we all have.**

Between a million wallets across a dozen chains, an uncomfortable number of chat room apps all trying to accomplish the same thing, and an error-filled purist interpretation of what NFT users want, a lot of users get exhausted.

A lot of developers see the peak, but not the mountain before them. We believe the space needs a few more practicians and less modern day visionaries.

**Is this really the best experience Web3 has to offer?**

The answer is **no**, and we're here to solve that. Build what works. Make it simple. And fill the neverending veld of needs for a community that is begging for broader adoption.

> _on one hand, the crypto space is beautiful in that it's evolving, literally all the time... I can't think of a time where creators weren't trying to build something new but on the other hand, it adds a massive amount of friction into the system ... **and my gut tells me, I think the space would be better off slowing down.**_

## White Paper Outline

We want to walk you through the key ideas that helped us develop <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View,</mark> before diving into the application specifications and API.

**This document will serve as an up-to-date white paper outlining our goals, initiatives, and foundation behind **<mark style="color:purple;">**Veld View**</mark>**. We have a lot of big ideas, but we're practicians at heart. We're here to develop, and build simple.**&#x20;

This document is structured first as a narrative around the founding of our Company and the original idea, and then transition to higher-level product specs and our roadmap for API / digitalization. We aim to update it - often.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Idea:** Feedback is extremely encouraged. Please do not hesitate to reach out to the team!

### The Importance of Hybridization

One key aspect that we're putting front and center on Veld View is the importance of combination. We want to take the strengths of successful off-chain social interactions, and combine them with on-chain infrastructure in a seamless way.
