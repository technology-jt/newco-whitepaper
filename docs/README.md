# Official White Paper

<mark style="color:purple;">**Veld View**</mark> is a widget-enabled social NFT platform that is focused on bridging the gap between on- and off-chain users.

**The platform is dedicated to bringing an incredibly simple social experience to a space that desperately needs it.**&#x20;

We want to stand on the shoulders of those that have built successful platforms before us. We want to take what works, and learn from it. And with that advantage, we want to fill and develop in a void that deserves better: web3 and the NFT space.

## Our Story

The idea behind <mark style="color:purple;">**Veld View**</mark> is simple and ultimately born out of practical experiences. It's an accumulation of these experiences, both in and out of the web3 space, that many of us have been through already. And to best explain what we're trying to develop, we're going to take a step back.&#x20;

**For most new adopters in the crypto and web3-media space, the process of purchasing an NFT is painstakingly complicated**.

And through this process, a lot of valid questions are usually asked:

{% hint style="danger" %}
1. Do I own this image? Who is the author? Are there others like it?
2. Can I trust the seller? Is this a scam? Is it safe to connect my wallet?
3. How do I talk to other people in my shoes?
4. What next?
{% endhint %}

**The adoption tends to end there, hard stop.**

The perception of value at risk, and the lack of utility beyond accumulation, usually turns most web2 users away. And for the folks that stick around, it's a rabbit-hole of never-ending learning, collecting, and navigating the space that travels at lightspeed.

For the hyper-interested, they've likely established an on-chain presence across platforms. There's implicit needs and interests for how they want to engage with the space. They want to connect with others interested in the things they're interested in, they want to talk to people and learn about what's next, they want to see engagement from others in the space, and they want privacy at their control.&#x20;

**And in pursuit of many of these things, you're likely to make a few mistakes along the way. We all have.**

Between a million wallets across a dozen chains, an uncomfortable number of chat room apps all trying to accomplish the same thing, and an error-filled purist approach to what NFT users want, a lot of users get exhausted.

There's too much friction. A lot of developers and visionaries see the peak, but not the mountain before them. It's practically a full-time job just trying to keep up.

**Is this really the best experience Web3 has to offer?**

The answer is **no**, and we're here to _solve_ that.

> _on one hand, the crypto space is beautiful in that it's evolving, literally all the time... I can't think of a time where creators weren't trying to build something new. but on the other hand, it adds a massive amount of friction into the system ... and my gut tells me, I think the space would be better off slowing down._

## White Paper Outline

We want to walk you through the key ideas that helped us develop <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View,</mark> before diving into the application specifications and API.

**This document will serve as an up-to-date white paper outlining our goals, initiatives, and foundation behind **<mark style="color:purple;">**Veld View**</mark>**. We have a lot of big ideas, but we're practicians at heart. We're here to develop, and build simple.**&#x20;

This document is structured first as a narrative around the founding of our Company and the original idea, and then transition to higher-level product specs and our roadmap for API / digitalization. We aim to update it - often.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Idea:** Feedback is extremely encouraged. Please do not hesitate to reach out to the team!

### The NFT Ecosystem

The NFT space can be tricky. For all users, stakeholders, and people interested in <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark> - we want to take a minute to explain the current state of affairs.

### The Importance of Hybridization

One key aspect that we're putting front and center on Veld View is the importance of combination. We want to take the strengths of successful off-chain social interactions, and combine them with on-chain infrastructure in a seamless way.

### Wrapping Up: Veld View as a Solution

The space has, and will continue to evolve at supersonic speed. We're here to build something that will survive change. <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark> by design will only grow with adoption.

And for one reason or another, we'll be here, moving towards the next veld.&#x20;
