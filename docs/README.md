# Official White Paper

{% hint style="success" %}
**Focus:** <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark> is a flexible platform focused on bringing on-and-off chain users together.
{% endhint %}

## Our Story

The idea behind <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark> is simple, but clear. In most cases, it's an accumulation of experiences many of us have been through already. And to best explain what we're trying to develop, we're going to take a step back.&#x20;

Imagine you're trading your first NFT, one that _really_ caught your eye, and you can't help but ask:

{% hint style="danger" %}
1. Do I own this picture? Who made it?
2. Can I trust the seller? Is this a scam?
3. How I do find more projects like this?
4. How can I connect with other people in the space?
{% endhint %}

And after that initial uncertainty goes away, you probably ape in head first. And again. And again.

Fast forward, and your wallet size has grown. You've dipped your toes into a few different projects. You've established an on-chain presence across platforms to connect with others just like you ... and like most of us, you've probably made a few mistakes along the way.

Between a million wallets across ten chains, five chat room apps all trying to accomplish the same thing, and a general sense of friction when interacting with the space - it's become a full-time job.

**Is this really the best experience Web3 has to offer?**

The answer is **no**, and we're here to solve that.

> _On one hand, the crypto space is beautiful in that it's evolving, literally all the time. I can't think of a time where creators weren't trying to build something new. But on the other hand, it adds a massive amount of friction into the system ... and my gut tells me, I think the space would be better off slowing down._

### The Importance of Hybridization

One key aspect that we're putting front and center on Veld View is the importance of combination. We want to take the strengths of successful off-chain social interactions, and combine them with on-chain infrastructure in a seamless way.
