# VELD VIEW

## Our Story

{% hint style="success" %}
**Focus:** <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark> is a flexible platform focused on bringing on-and-off chain users together.
{% endhint %}

The idea behind <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark> is simple, but clear. In most cases, it's an accumulation of experiences many of us have been through already. And to best explain what we're trying to develop, we're going to take a step back.&#x20;

Imagine you're trading your first NFT, one that _really_ caught your eye, and you can't help but ask:

{% hint style="danger" %}
1. Who created this, and why? What am I missing?
2. How can I trust the other side of the transaction? Is this a scam?
3. Why didn't I catch this before, and how I do find more projects like this?
4. Do I know anyone else involved? How do I connect with them?&#x20;
{% endhint %}

And after that initial uncertainty drips away, you probably ape in head first. And again. And again.

Fast forward, and your wallet size has grown. You've dipped your toes into a few different projects. You've established an on-chain presence across platforms to connect with others just like you ... and like most of us, you've probably made a few mistakes along the way.

Between different wallets across ten chains, five different chat room apps all trying to accomplish the same thing, and the general sense of friction when interacting with the space - it's become a full-time job.

**Is this really the best experience Web3 has to offer?**

The answer is **no**, and we're here to solve that.

> _On one hand, the crypto space is beautiful in that it's evolving, literally all the time. I can't think of a time where creators weren't trying to build something new. But on the other hand, it adds a massive amount of friction into the system ... and my gut tells me, I think the space would be better off slowing down._

## White Paper Outline

We want to walk you through a few of the key ideas that helped us develop <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark> before diving into the application itself.

This document will serve as an up-to-date white paper outlining our goals, initiatives, and development behind <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark>. The document is structured first as a narrative to the founding of the Company and the application, and then transition to higher-level product specs and our roadmap for API / digitalization. We aim to update it often.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Idea:** Feedback is extremely encouraged. Please do not hesitate to reach out to the team!

### The NFT Ecosystem

The NFT space can be tricky. For all users, stakeholders, and people interested in <mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark> - we want to take a minute to explain the current state of affairs.

### The Importance of Hybridization

One key aspect that we're putting front and center on Veld View is the importance of combination. We want to take the strengths of successful off-chain social interactions, and combine them with on-chain infrastructure in a seamless way.

### Wrapping Up: Veld View as a Solution

The space has, and will continue to evolve at supersonic speed. We're here to build something that will survive change.

<mark style="color:purple;">Veld View</mark> by design will only grow with adoption. Integrate your identity on the chain, in a truly additive fashion. And for one reason or another, we're always headed towards next veld.&#x20;
