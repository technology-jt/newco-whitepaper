# Ecosystem

## Overview

The current ecosystem is plagued by disconnect. To facilitate consolidation of user assets and a gateway for users to link with one another, Veld focuses on overcoming the following challenges:

* **Disjointed and disparate profile engagement -** currently, most users have a number of wallets and profiles that they can only access via separate, native connections and log-ins. Veld fixes this by importing and consolidating a userâ€™s on- and off-chain assets into one unified profile.
* **Lack of transparent user engagement -** currently, users cannot contact one another to inquire about certain assets, such as NFTs, nor can they actively track _hot_ NFT collection drops. The only view provided to users is via third-party applications whereby NFT sellers have to actively list their NFTs for users to be able to confirm ownership and track NFT transactions. With Veld, our user community can easily view assets of other users and engage them for NFT sales prior to active listing, as well as follow them to view their active purchases and partake in new NFT movements. Users can send direct messages to one another in a transparent manner to inquire about specific assets and follow their favorite users to gain exclusive access to those NFT collections for which there is rapid growing interest.
* **Lack of personal data ownership** - currently, users do not own the data they provide in the social media space. Users are forced to succumb to paid advertisements to monetize their accounts, which completely deprives them of the _true_ social experience they deserve. Veld overcomes this obstacle by putting data ownership back in the hands of users, allowing them to build and store value through our Partner Program and share their transaction history with their followers.
